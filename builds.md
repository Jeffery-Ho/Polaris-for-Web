# Builds

## Build Rule

- Build number uses plain integers from `1` to `999`, sorted by numeric order.
- Every code or documentation modification must record a new build.
- Bug fix updates the last version segment, for example `0.1.0` to `0.1.1`.
- Feature update updates the middle version segment, for example `0.1.0` to `0.2.0`.
- Major update updates the first version segment, for example `0.1.0` to `1.0.0`.
- Version update type must be declared by the user before recording a build.
- After each build is recorded, confirm the build number and version with the user.
